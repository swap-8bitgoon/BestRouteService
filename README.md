# Getting Started

Few things to note:
I've used the Depth-First Search Algorithm for traversing all the paths and choosing the best one 
I've not used the haversine formula for calculating distance as it was very complex to implement.
Instead, I've considered the lat and long to be the x and y coordinates in a 2D plane and calculate the distance that way.

Few things I'd like to improve:
Improve the algorithm to handle all sorts of edge cases
Use the haversine formula
Add exception handling and unit tests for testability
